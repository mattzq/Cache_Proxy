This is the danger log for erss-hwk2.
In this file, We will list thoughts on possible risks our program may have.

[Proxy]
1. The proxy may receive some malformed requests or responses.
2. The body of requests or responses can be very huge and the size of it may exceed the max_size of the container.
3. We designed a socket class and a fd class which have destructors releasing resources automacatically when these classes go out of the scope.
4. When the proxy meets some situations which it cannot handle, it will print error messages and exit gracefully.
5. When the proxy need to do some changes to those resources already existed, we use a temperary object to avoid modifying in case of exceptions.
especially in the copy constructor, the assignment operator and the function updates the body.
6. The client may send bad requests.
7. Sometimes the file descriptor may be too much.
8. Different protocols like FTP from user.

[Cache]
1. Browser has local cache and even if we close our proxy they are still existed and will send revalidate request;
2. When reading a cache, some other thread maybe do something to such cache;
3. Cache-Control field are splited with comma and space, not only comma;
4. Time value are not GMT version;
5. HTTP Field is sometimes lower-case;
6. Both Request and Response Header may contain "no-store";
7. Storing too much cache is wasteful and we need a evicting method;
8. Calling copy constructor may cause failure of copying;
